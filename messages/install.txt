iifefy
---------------------

This plugin provides two commands:

  iifefy:
    Wraps each current selection in an IIFE. If nothing is selected it wraps the entire document.

  iifefy_skip_initial_comments:
    Same as iifefy, except it begins wrapping at the first non-comment, non-blank line. This is
    useful for certain per-file configuration comments, which some prefer to keep as the opening
    line.

  Both of these commands add 'use strict'; and a trailing newline to each IIFE by default, but you
  can change the opening and closing strings that form the IIFE to whatever you like under
  Preferences > Package Settings > iifefy > Settings - User.


How to use these commands:

  Main menu:
    Edit > Wrap > Wrap selection/document in IIFE

  Context (right-click) menu:
    Wrap selection/document in IIFE

  Keyboard shortcut:
    Can be added by going to Preferences > Key Bindings - User and pasting the snippet to the file,
    replacing the key values with your preferred shortcuts:

      { "keys": [ "ctrl+i" ], "command": "iifefy", "context":
          [{ "key": "selector", "operator": "equal", "operand": "source.js", "match_all": true }]
      },
      { "keys": [ "ctrl+shift+i" ], "command": "iifefy_skip_initial_comments", "context":
          [{ "key": "selector", "operator": "equal", "operand": "source.js", "match_all": true }]
      }
