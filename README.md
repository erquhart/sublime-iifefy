# iifefy

A Sublime Text 3 plugin for wrapping Javascript code in immediately invoking function expressions.

## Installation

### Using [Package Control][pkgcontrol] (*Recommended*)

For all Sublime Text 2/3 users we recommend install via [Package Control][pkgcontrol].

1. [Install][pkgcontrol-install] Package Control if you haven't already
2. Use `cmd+shift+P` (or `ctrl+shift+P` for Windows) then select `Package Control: Install Package`
3. Search for `iifefy` and select to install

### Manual Install

1. Click the `Preferences > Browse Packagesâ€¦` menu
2. Browse up a folder and then into the `Installed Packages/` folder
3. Download the [zip archive][zip], rename it to `Iifefy.sublime-package` and copy it into the `Installed Packages/` directory
4. Restart Sublime Text

## Usage

This plugin provides two commands:

`iifefy`: Wraps each current selection in an IIFE. If nothing is selected it wraps the entire document.

`iifefy_skip_initial_comments`: Same as `iifefy`, except it begins wrapping at the first non-comment, non-blank line. This is useful for certain per-file configuration comments, which some prefer to keep as the opening line.

Both of these commands add `'use strict';` and a trailing newline to each IIFE by default, but you can change the opening and closing strings that form the IIFE to whatever you like under `Preferences > Package Settings > iifefy > Settings - User`.

The commands themselves are accessible directly in the context menu and from the `Edit > Wrap` submenu. Keyboard shortcuts can be added by going to `Preferences > Key Bindings - User` and adding the following to the file, replacing the key values with your preferred shortcuts:

```
{ "keys": [ "ctrl+i" ], "command": "iifefy", "context":
    [{ "key": "selector", "operator": "equal", "operand": "source.js", "match_all": true }]
},
{ "keys": [ "ctrl+shift+i" ], "command": "iifefy_skip_initial_comments", "context":
    [{ "key": "selector", "operator": "equal", "operand": "source.js", "match_all": true }]
}
```

## Usage

If there are any selections, they'll be wrapped.

If there are no selections, the entire document will be wrapped.

There's a "skip_initial_comments" version of the command, which will begin wrapping at the first
non-comment, non-blank line.

Lastly, this plugin adds 'use strict' and a trailing newline to every IIFE by default. If making
this configurable would be helpful for you, open an issue.
